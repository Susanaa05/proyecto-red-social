# proyecto-red-social
Proyecto diseño con algoritmos: creación de una red social


Development of a social network application.

Requirements
1. The application must have a main dashboard where published data and information
can be accessed by users.
2. The application must include an authentication flow, allowing users to register with
relevant information and log in using an email and password.
3. Only users who are logged in should be able to upload posts to the application.
4. Users must be able to edit their profile information.
5. Interaction between users must be guaranteed.
6. All group members should have a similar level of participation in the project’s code
and understanding of it.
7. The project must make use of the technologies covered during the course.
8. All deliverables must be built under the concept of “Pixel Perfect” based on the initial
design (with room for adjustments).
9. Course concepts, principles, technologies, and instructor guidelines must be properly
applied, along with clean and well-structured code.
10. Every part of the project must be provided in English.
11. The project must be hosted on a platform-as-a-service provider such as Firebase,
GitHub Pages, or similar.
12. The project must include a logout button.
13. You must have a public remote repository where constantly add changes to. MAKE
SURE TO NOT INCLUDE THE NODE_MODULES FOLDER.

Deliverables

1. Sep. 19: Project planning
a. Project design: You must present high-fidelity design mockups for your
social network.
b. Project argument: You must explain the conceptualization behind the
project.
c. Planning: You must provide a route map explaining how the different
features of the application would be created and delivered. It must also have

code conduct for the developers involved that guarantees: commits
convention, branching model, and technologies/libraries to use while
developing the project.
d. Diagrams: You must provide diagrams explaining the different flows that the
user would take to complete actions in the app. You must provide a
components diagram that shows the different components that the project will
need and how they interact width each other. You could also have a more
structured diagram model called UML if you feel more comfortable with it.
e. Scaffolding: You must provide a starting point for your project, that includes
file system structure and dev-dependencies to use.

2. Oct. 17: MVP v0.1 Static dashboard
a. You must develop the main screen of your application. This is where your
users will have their content published.
b. You must support every screen size by making it fully responsive.
c. This screen must be fully functional, meaning that the actions that users are
supposed to do, are able to be done (every button must work).
d. Since you don’t have registered users capable of uploading data, you must
have mocked data (data file) from where the content of the application is
consumed.
e. Take a look at the Rubrics file for this deliverable so you guarantee to
have everything that is expected, including coding expectations.

3. Nov. 7: MVP v0.2 Dynamic dashboard
a. You must develop the 90% of the screen in your application. Allowing the
user to navigate between them.
b. You must support every screen size by making it fully responsive.
c. These screens must be fully functional, meaning that the actions that users
are supposed to do, are able to be done (every button must work).
d. Makes correct use of data persistence on the users' local device.
e. A global state of the application must be created correctly and integrated with
the interactions in the components.
f. The main screen is dynamic, allowing user interaction with all its
functionalities.
g. Since you don’t have registered users capable of uploading data, you must
have mocked data (data file) or would be rendered from a dynamic source by
using APIs from where the content of the application is consumed.
h. Take a look at the Rubrics file for this deliverable so you guarantee to
have everything that is expected, including coding expectations.

4. Nov. 28: R. v1.0 Final Release |
a. You must have reaced the 100% of the development process. Make sure You
delivered accordingly to the requirements described at the beginning of this
document.

b. Present how the planning in terms of design, route map, diagrams, git usage
and others changed on the process.
c. Data must be pulled from a custom DB in real time reflecting changes to
every user.
d. The authentication flow must be fully working by using an auth provider, so
we could register actual users.
e. The Storage service is fully working, hosting any media content uploaded
from the users.
f. The project must be hosted in a public server, so is accessible from any
device anywhere.
g. Take a look at the Rubrics file for this deliverable so you guarantee to
have everything that is expected, including coding expectations.
